### Project 1  
### Exploring Weather trends

In this project, I'm analyzing local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.
Created visualizations and prepared a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends.

### Project 2
### Investigating movie dataset

Conduct data analysis on movie dataset. Used pandas and NumPy to answer the following questions:

1. What attributes are associated with highest grossing (revenue) movies. (Like genre, ratings, popularity etc.)
2. How has genre popularity changed over the years.
